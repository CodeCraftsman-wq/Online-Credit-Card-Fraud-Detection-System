/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the credit card fraud detection system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access
 * their own profile and the transactions associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user with the matching
 *   UID can read or write to this document.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data for a user.
 *   Each transaction document includes a 'userId' field that must match the
 *   'userId' in the path. This ensures that only the owner of the user account can
 *   create, read, update, or delete transactions associated with their account.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Transaction documents are secured by path-based ownership and validated against
 *   the 'userId' field within the document.
 * - All write operations are restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'userId' field is denormalized into the Transaction documents to enable
 * Authorization Independence. This avoids costly and complex `get()` calls in the
 * security rules to check user ownership.
