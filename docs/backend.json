    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support a fraud detection system with user accounts and transaction tracking. It prioritizes security, scalability, and debuggability. Authorization Independence is achieved by leveraging path-based ownership for transactions, ensuring that each transaction is directly associated with a user's document. This eliminates the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules to determine ownership. Structural Segregation is maintained by placing all transactions for a user within a subcollection of their user document, ensuring that all documents within the `/users/{userId}/transactions` collection share the same security requirements. This also enforces the `User 1:N Transaction` relationship. The design supports the required QAPs by using path-based ownership and storing each user's transactions in the subcollection `/users/{userId}/transactions`. This structure makes it straightforward to write security rules that allow only the authenticated user to access their own transactions."
